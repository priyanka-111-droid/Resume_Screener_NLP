## Introduction

One of the biggest obstacles recruiters face in the ever-changing talent acquisition landscape is the laborious effort of manually sorting through a vast number of resumes. In this deluge of data, recruiters frequently struggle with the need to quickly and accurately identify the most suitable prospects.

In this project, we examine the urgent need to automate the screening of resumes and the numerous advantages that come with using NLP-powered systems. Recruiters may improve the accuracy of candidate evaluation, considerably cut down on the time and expense of manual resume screening, and optimise their workflow by utilising natural language processing (NLP).
